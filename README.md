#  Airbnb Clone Project

This project is a full-stack simulation of the Airbnb platform. It allows users to register, list properties, make bookings, write reviews, and handle payments, all within a secure and scalable web application.


##  Project Goals

- Gain hands-on experience in full-stack web development.
- Understand backend systems using Django and PostgreSQL.
- Practice collaborative workflows and Git/GitHub practices.
- Learn to plan and document a software project professionally.
- Simulate industry-level application design with CI/CD and security measures.



##  Team Roles

###  Backend Developer  
Responsible for implementing API endpoints, designing and maintaining database schemas, and writing the core business logic of the application. They ensure that all backend services work efficiently and securely.

###  Database Administrator (DBA)  
Manages the structure and performance of the PostgreSQL database. This includes designing schemas, setting up relationships between tables, managing indexing for performance, and ensuring data integrity and backups.

###  DevOps Engineer  
Handles the deployment, monitoring, and scaling of backend services. Sets up Docker containers, CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions), manages environments, and ensures the application runs smoothly across development and production.

###  QA Engineer  
Ensures backend functionalities are properly tested. This includes writing and running unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests to maintain high reliability and prevent regressions.

## 🗃️ Data Design

This section outlines the core data models (entities) of the Airbnb Clone project and how they relate to each other.

### 🔐 Users
Stores data about people using the platform (both hosts and guests).
- `id`: Unique user ID
- `username`: Account handle
- `email`: Contact email
- `password_hash`: Encrypted password
- `created_at`: Account creation timestamp

**Relationships:**  
A user can host multiple properties and make multiple bookings. A user can also write reviews and process payments.

### 🏠 Properties
Represents homes or apartments listed on the platform.
- `id`: Unique property ID
- `user_id`: Foreign key to the host (owner)
- `title`: Listing title
- `description`: Property details
- `location`: City/country info
- `price_per_night`: Cost of staying per night

**Relationships:**  
A property belongs to one host (user). It can have multiple bookings and reviews.

### 📅 Bookings
Captures reservation details made by guests.
- `id`: Unique booking ID
- `user_id`: Foreign key to the guest
- `property_id`: Foreign key to the booked property
- `start_date`: Check-in date
- `end_date`: Check-out date

**Relationships:**  
A booking links a guest to a specific property. One property can have many bookings.

### 💳 Payments
Handles financial transactions related to bookings.
- `id`: Unique payment ID
- `booking_id`: Linked booking
- `amount`: Total paid
- `payment_method`: e.g., card, PayPal
- `status`: Completed, Failed, etc.

**Relationships:**  
Each payment is tied to a specific booking.
### ✍️ Reviews
Feedback and ratings left by users after a stay.
- `id`: Unique review ID
- `user_id`: Reviewer
- `property_id`: Reviewed listing
- `rating`: Numerical score (e.g. 1–5)
- `comment`: Optional feedback

**Relationships:**  
Each review belongs to one user and one property.

## 🌐 REST API Endpoints (Planned)

### Users
- `GET /users/` — List all users  
- `POST /users/` — Create a new user  
- `GET /users/{user_id}/` — Get a specific user  
- `PUT /users/{user_id}/` — Update user details  
- `DELETE /users/{user_id}/` — Delete user  

### Properties
- `GET /properties/`  
- `POST /properties/`  
- `GET /properties/{property_id}/`  
- `PUT /properties/{property_id}/`  
- `DELETE /properties/{property_id}/`  

### Bookings
- `GET /bookings/`  
- `POST /bookings/`  
- `GET /bookings/{booking_id}/`  
- `PUT /bookings/{booking_id}/`  
- `DELETE /bookings/{booking_id}/`  

### Payments
- `POST /payments/` — Process a payment  

### Reviews
- `GET /reviews/`  
- `POST /reviews/`  
- `GET /reviews/{review_id}/`  
- `PUT /reviews/{review_id}/`  
- `DELETE /reviews/{review_id}/`  





## 🚀 Feature Breakdown

The Airbnb Clone project replicates essential features of a real-world rental platform. Each feature is designed to provide a smooth experience for both property owners and guests.

### 👤 User Management  
Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. This feature ensures secure access control and personalized user experiences based on account roles (e.g., host vs guest).

### 🏘️ Property Management  
Enables hosts to list, update, and delete properties. Property details include location, pricing, images, and descriptions. This forms the core inventory of the platform.

### 📅 Booking System  
Allows guests to search for available properties and make reservations for specific dates. The system manages date availability, booking conflicts, and payment integration.

### 💬 Review System  
After completing a stay, users can leave feedback and ratings. Reviews help build trust and transparency between hosts and guests, improving the platform’s credibility.

### 💵 Payment Integration  
Securely handles payments between guests and hosts using preferred payment methods. Ensures successful booking transactions while logging payment details for transparency.

### 🔐 Authentication & Authorization  
Protects access to sensitive resources using token-based authentication. Ensures users only perform actions permitted by their roles (e.g., a guest can’t delete someone else’s property).




## 🔐 API Security

### 🔑 Authentication  
Only verified users should access protected resources.  This prevents unauthorized access to user profiles, bookings, and other sensitive endpoints.

### ✅ Authorization  
Once authenticated, users should only be able to perform actions allowed by their role. For example, a guest should not be able to edit another user’s property. Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures proper permission management across the platform.


### 📉 Rate Limiting  
To prevent abuse and brute-force attacks, the API will implement rate limiting — restricting the number of requests a user/IP can make within a time frame. This helps mitigate DDoS attacks and API spamming.

### 🧼 Input Validation & Sanitization  
All incoming data will be validated and sanitized to avoid common vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS). This ensures the backend only processes safe and expected inputs.


### 🔒 Secure Payments  
Payment endpoints will use HTTPS and integrate with trusted third-party payment processors. Tokenization and encryption will be used to ensure payment data never lives in plain text on our servers.

### 📜 Logging & Monitoring  
Critical actions (like failed logins, payments, and booking changes) will be logged for auditing and anomaly detection. This helps detect and respond to suspicious activity.





## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code. They help reduce manual errors, speed up delivery, and ensure that new changes do not break existing features.

In a collaborative project like this Airbnb Clone, CI/CD ensures that:
- Code is automatically tested before merging to the main branch.
- Deployment happens consistently across environments (dev, staging, production).
- Bugs and regressions are caught early through automated checks.

### 🧰 Tools We Can Use

- **GitHub Actions**: Automates workflows like running tests, linting code, and deploying to servers or cloud platforms when code is pushed.
- **Docker**: Containerizes the application, making it portable and consistent across environments.
- **Heroku / AWS / DigitalOcean**: Can be used as deployment platforms that work seamlessly with GitHub Actions.
- **PostgreSQL (Cloud-hosted)**: To maintain consistent production-ready databases for staging and live apps.

### 🛠️ Sample CI/CD Flow
1. Developer pushes code to GitHub  
2. GitHub Actions runs unit tests and lint checks  
3. If all checks pass, Docker builds the app  
4. App is deployed to Heroku or another platform  
5. Slack/Email notifications can alert the team of success/failure
