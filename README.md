#  Airbnb Clone Project

This project is a full-stack simulation of the Airbnb platform. It allows users to register, list properties, make bookings, write reviews, and handle payments, all within a secure and scalable web application.


##  Project Goals

- Gain hands-on experience in full-stack web development.
- Understand backend systems using Django and PostgreSQL.
- Practice collaborative workflows and Git/GitHub practices.
- Learn to plan and document a software project professionally.
- Simulate industry-level application design with CI/CD and security measures.


##  Technology Stack

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
- **Django REST Framework**: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
- **GraphQL**: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
- **Celery**: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
- **Redis**: Used for caching and session management.
- **Docker**: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.


##  Team Roles

###  Backend Developer  
Responsible for implementing API endpoints, designing and maintaining database schemas, and writing the core business logic of the application. They ensure that all backend services work efficiently and securely.

###  Database Administrator (DBA)  
Manages the structure and performance of the PostgreSQL database. This includes designing schemas, setting up relationships between tables, managing indexing for performance, and ensuring data integrity and backups.

###  DevOps Engineer  
Handles the deployment, monitoring, and scaling of backend services. Sets up Docker containers, CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions), manages environments, and ensures the application runs smoothly across development and production.

###  QA Engineer  
Ensures backend functionalities are properly tested. This includes writing and running unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests to maintain high reliability and prevent regressions.
